> Big O notation is used to describ the computational complexity of an algorithm.
> Computational complexity : time complexity and space complexity.
> Time complexiti is the amt time the algorithm needs to run relative.
> Space complexity is the amount of size the algo needs to run relative to the input size. 
> complexity described by function of variables that can change with the input.
